This project explores fundamental concepts and techniques in speech processing. It covers essential topics such as recording, analyzing, and visualizing speech signals, as well as estimating the fundamental frequency of speech. The project also implements Voice Activity Detection (VAD) to distinguish between speech and non-speech segments and applies various speech enhancement techniques to improve audio quality.
